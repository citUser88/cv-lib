# CV-LIB
# Cross-platform graphics
   by Cara Vincent

## Project Goals

Finish refactoring and cleaning up the code.  Create cross-platform code for Android and iOS systems.  Use CMAKE.  Adding documentation and removing all exterior library dependencies, excluding required OS, DirectX, Vulkan and OpenGL library bindings.  Add CMAKE targets for GCC.  This was written in Visual Studio and the project library dependencies are setup for debug build versions of the libraries used.  In a nutshell, cleaning up the code, removing unwanted dependencies and adding support for desired systems, APIS and graphics libraries.

Main goals for this library are to create a multi-threaded DirectX, Vulkan and OpenGL framework for writing real time graphics applications with.  Including games, physics based, scientific, machine-learning and artificial intelligence workloads.
